## How to Read This

This page is a supplement to the React doc on Contextâ€”found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

Your mileage may vary.

## Thanks

This thing was much worse (read "wrong") before [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/) reviewed it.

Thanks Dan for your patience, empathy, and clarity.
