## A "Shit" Example

My kids are allowed tasteful explitives.
"Shit"â€”for exampleâ€”is fine in my house.
My momâ€”howeverâ€”hates the word.

I tell Rockâ€”my 7 year oldâ€”"there's nothing wrong with the word 'shit'.
Mr. Roger's loved the word.
But you're grandma hates it.
So don't say it around her.
Use 'poop' instead."

"Who is Mr. Rogers?", he'll asks.
I think he gets it.

Let's implement this scenareo of "shit", Rock, and grandma's house using React's Context API (>= v16.4).

```jsx
// It's ok to say "shit" as a default.
let ExpletiveContext = React.createContext("shit");

// Some people don't like the word "shit".
// Use a differnt word, when in their company.
// It's good manners.
let ContextualExclamation = () => (
  <ExpletiveContext.Consumer>
    {word => <span>Oh {word}!</span>}
  </ExpletiveContext.Consumer>
);

// Grandma *hates* the word "shit".
// Say "poop" at Grandma's house.
let GrandmasHouse = props => (
  <ExpletiveContext.Provider value="poop" {...props} />
);

// Go have fun at Grandma's!
// What do you say when anything bad or exciting happens?
let VisitToGrandmasHouse = () => (
  <GrandmasHouse>
    <ContextualExclamation />
  </GrandmasHouse>
);

// => Oh poop!
```

## Create, Consume, and Provide Context

Context is a 3-part system.
You **create** it, **consume** it, and **provide** it.

**Create, consume, provide**. Create, consume, provide... keep repeating that.

### Create Context

Create a Context using React's `createContext` function.

```jsx
import React from "react";

let NameameContext = React.createContext();
```

Provide a default "value" for Context by calling `createContext` with an argument.
Let's start easy with a string.

```jsx
let NameContext = React.createContext("Guest");
```

Our `NameContext` comprises two components, a `Consumer` and a `Provider`.

Let's dive into the `Consumer`.

### Consume Context

A Context's `Consumer` is a component that takes a [function as children](https://reactpatterns.com/#render-callback).

```jsx
let NameContext = React.createContext("Guest");

let ContextGreeting = () => (
  <NameContext.Consumer>{value => <h1>ðŸ‘‹ {value}!</h1>}</NameContext.Consumer>
);

// => <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Guest!</h1>
```

Here, `NameContext.Consumer` calls is `children` function with the default `value` it was created with.

Leterally:

```js
this.props.children("Guest");
```

So, how do we provide Context, where the default isn't acceptable?
I'm always glad you ask...

### Provide Context

A Context's `Provider` is a component that takes a `value` prop and makes it available to every nested componentâ€”no mater how deep.

Context Providers in close proximity:

```js
let NameContext = React.createContext("Guest");

let ContextGreeting = () => (
  <NameContext.Provider value="Michael">
    <NameContext.Consumer>{name => <h1>ðŸ‘‹ {name}!</h1>}</NameContext.Consumer>
  </NameContext.Provider>
);

// => <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Michael!</h1>
```

Context Providers also work where components are deeply nested:

```js
let NameContext = React.createContext("Guest");

let ContextAwareName = () => (
  <NameContext.Consumer>{name => <h1>ðŸ‘‹ {name}!</h1>}</NameContext.Consumer>
);

let NestedContextAwareName = () => <ContextAwareName />;

let DeeplyNestedContextAwareName = () => <NestedContextAwareName />;

let ContextGreeting = () => (
  <NameContext.Provider value="No Prop Drills">
    <DeeplyNestedContextAwareName />
  </NameContext.Provider>
);

// => <h1> Welcome No Prop Drills!</h1>
```

Prop Drills not required for assembly.

## Provide value

A Context's `value` can take any shape.
Here are examples of valid Context, using a default `value`:

```jsx
let StringContext = React.createContext("string");

let NumberContext = React.createContext(42);

let FunctionContext = React.createContext(() => alert("Context function"));

let ArrayContext = React.createContext(["some", "array", "elements"]);

let ObjectContext = React.createContext({
  aString: "string",
  aNumber: 42,
  aFunction: () => alert("Context function"),
  anArray: ["some", "array", "elements"]
});
```

`value` can be more complex structures like React Elements, class components, and functional components.

```jsx
let ReactElementContext = React.createContext(<span>React Element</span>);

let FunctionalComponentContext = React.createContext(props => (
  <span>Function Component</span>
));

let ClassComponentContext = React.createContext(
  class extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <span>Class Component</span>;
    }
  }
);
```

### value is required on Context Providers

Where a Context `Provider` is used, the `value` prop is required.

```jsx
<SomeContext.Provider value="value is a required prop">
  ...
</SomeContext.Provider>
```

## Authoring style

A Context's `Consumer` and `Provider` components can be accessed in 2 ways.

The Examples above use JSX' property access syntax.
This is the syntax used in official documentation.

```jsx
<SomeContext.Provider value="some value">
  <Context.Consumer>{value => <span>{value}</span>}</Context.Consumer>
</SomeContext.Provider>
```

You may prefer to use [object destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Object_destructuring) to assign Context components to local variables.

```jsx
// Destructure your Context's Consumer and Provider
const { Consumer, Provider } = NameContext;

<Provider value="some value">
  <Consumer>{value => <span>{value}</span>}</Consumer>
</Provider>;
```

Take care where multiple contexts are used.

```jsx
const { Consumer: OrgConsumer, Provider: OrganizationProvider } = OrganizationContext;
const { Consumer: UserConsumer, Provider: UserProvider } = UserContext;

<OrganizationProvider value="ACME Co.">
  <UserProvider value="Yakko">
    <UserProviderConsumer>
      {value => <span>{value}</span>}
    </UserProviderConsumer>
  </UserProvider>
<OrganizationProvider value="some value">
```

## Data Distribution, Not State Management

Context makes it possible to distribute data to every component in a component tree.

It is not a way to manage state.
Though it does provide the mechanism needed to distrubute data and update functions.

Here's an example of a Stateful Container that uses Context to distribute local `state` and an `update` function.

```jsx
let StateContext = React.createContext();

class StateProvider extends React.Component {
  static defaultProps = {
    initialState: {}
  };

  state = { ...this.props.initialState };

  update = (...args) => this.setState.apply(this, args);

  render() {
    return (
      <StateContext.Provider
        value={{
          state: this.state,
          update: this.update
        }}
        {...this.props}
      />
    );
  }
}

let App = () => (
  <StateProvider initialState={{ count: 0 }}>
    <StateContext.Consumer>
      {({ state, update }) => (
        <div>
          <div>{state.count}</div>

          <button
            type="button"
            onClick={() =>
              update(({ count }) => ({ count: count + 1 }))
            }
          >
            increment
          </button>
        </div>
      )}
    </StateContext.Consumer>
  </StateProvider>
);

```

## A Mental Model for Context

TODO: add illustrations
TODO: maybe use a different analogy because lots of people don't have a lot of experience with sprinklers

I think of Context as the head of a sprinkler.
Without a sprinkler head, water irrigation shoots directly out of pipes in a straight line.

The sprinkler head distributes that water to the places it needs to go.

## Does Context "replace" or "deprecate" Redux?

No.

Not even a little.

Here's how [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) describes itself:

> Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
>
> It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test... it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

React implements an architecture that is not React-specific.
This is an overwhelming value to companies that use multiple UI frameworks.
Angular, Ember, Vue, Backbone, no frameworkâ€”Redux can manage state for all apps.
You can't achieve this same result with Context.
While you might use React's new Context API to implement the same architecture, it will always be React-spefic.

The bindings for Reduxâ€”[react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)â€”use the existing Context to `Connect` React components to Redux Storesâ€”consuming data and dispatch actions.
While React's new Context API exposes a stable Context API,
it does not fundamentally change how react-redux has always worked.

In the future, Redux will continue implementing this architecture using React's new Context API.

The benefit of Redux is its framework agnosticism, vibrant community, powerfully tooling, tremendous documentation, and .
These are not things "replaced" or "deprecated" by the announcement of a stable Context API.
