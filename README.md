## A Mental Model for Context

TODO: add illustrations
TODO: maybe use a different analogy because lots of people don't have a lot of experience with sprinklers

I think of Context as the head of a sprinkler.
Without a sprinkler head, water irrigation shoots directly out of pipes in a straight line.

The sprinkler head distributes that water to the places it needs to go.
